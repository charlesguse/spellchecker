My name is Charlie Guse and this is my solution for the spellcheck problem.

Non-explaining list version of instructions:

Compiling the source:
    Open up source/spellcheck/spellcheck.sln
    Compile it.
    Open up source/spellcheck/spellcheck/bin/Debug(and Release) and put american-english
    Rename american-english words for the program.

    Follow the same instructions for unspeller to compile and use that.

Using NUnit:
    Install from http://www.nunit.org/
    Run NUnit 2.5.10\bin\net-2.0\nunit-x86.exe (NOT nunit.exe)
    File > Open Project... and open source/nunit_spellcheck/spellcheck.nunit (give an error if the source isn't compiled)
    
    Same for source/nunit_unspeller/unspeller.nunit


Explaining paragraph version of instructions:  

    If you compile the source code, you will have to manually put the american-english
dictionary in the Debug/Release folder and rename it words. I didn't make a post-
build step for that because I only had to do it once. I deleted all of the pre-
compiled stuff before sending it to you though. Since you know... space is an issue. ;)
I just wanted to put the source code in it's most basic form as if you were pulling it
down from source control.

    I used NUnit 2.5.10.11092 for unit testing. If you use the default executable
(nunit.exe) you will get a BadImageFormat exception. There is a second executable
named nunit-x86.exe that you need to use instead. If you are unfamiliar with NUnit,
to use it, open up nunit-x86.exe, File > Open Project... and then go to
source/nunit_spellcheck/spellcheck.nunit to load the unit test project. If you get
an error saying Assembly Not Loaded, you will have to compile the Spellcheck project
once first so it can find the Release version of the dlls.

    This was created in .net 4.0.
